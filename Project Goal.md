The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate whether the corporate division can be compromised and, if so, determine if it could compromise the bank division. A simulated fraudulent money transfer must be performed to fully demonstrate the compromise.

To do this safely, ==TheReserve will create two new core banking accounts for you. You will need to demonstrate that it's possible to transfer funds between these two accounts.== The only way this is possible is by gaining access to SWIFT, the core backend banking system.
