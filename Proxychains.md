## Overview
Proxychains is a tool used for routing network traffic through proxy servers. It is often used by security professionals, researchers, and hackers to anonymize their network traffic and bypass network restrictions.

Proxychains works by intercepting network traffic generated by applications on the local system and redirecting it through a series of proxy servers before reaching its destination. This allows users to hide their real IP address and location from the destination server, making it more difficult to trace their activities back to them.
Here's a basic overview of how Proxychains works:

1. **Configuration**: Proxychains is configured using a configuration file typically located at `/etc/proxychains.conf` on Linux systems. This file contains settings for specifying proxy servers and their corresponding ports.
   
2. **Usage**: To use Proxychains, you simply prepend the `proxychains` command to the command you want to run. For example:

   
	`proxychains curl https://example.com`
    
	This command would use Proxychains to route the `curl` command's network traffic through the proxy servers specified in the configuration file before reaching `https://example.com`.
    
3. **Dynamic Chaining**: Proxychains supports dynamic chaining, allowing users to specify a chain of multiple proxy servers to route their traffic through. This can further anonymize network traffic and make it more difficult to trace.

4. **Supported Protocols**: Proxychains supports a variety of network protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5. This makes it versatile and suitable for a wide range of applications and use cases.


## Installation
To install and configure `proxychains` on Kali Linux, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Proxychains

`proxychains` is usually pre-installed on Kali Linux, but if it isn't, you can install it using the package manager.

1. **Update package lists:**
   
    `sudo apt update`

2. **Install proxychains:**
 
    `sudo apt install proxychains4`


### Step 2: Install and Start Tor

Proxychains can work with various proxy types, but a common setup is using Tor as the proxy.

1. **Install Tor:**
   
    `sudo apt install tor`

2. **Start the Tor service:**
   
    `sudo service tor start`


### Step 3: Configure Proxychains

1. **Open the proxychains configuration file in a text editor:**
  
    `sudo nano /etc/proxychains4.conf`

2. **Edit the configuration file:**
    
    - **Uncomment the "dynamic_chain" option and comment out "strict_chain":**
    
        `# dynamic_chain
        
        Change it to
        
        `strict_chain`
        
    - **Add or ensure the following line exists under `[ProxyList]`:**
        
        
        `[ProxyList] 
        `socks4  127.0.0.1 9050`
        

> The default port is 9050, but any port will work as long as it matches the one we used when establishing the SSH tunnel.


3. **Save and exit the text editor:**
    
    - Press `CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and then `ENTER` to save the changes.

### Step 4: Using Proxychains

You can now use `proxychains` to run commands through the proxy specified in the configuration file.

1. **Basic usage example:**
     
    `proxychains4 <command>`
    
2. **Example with a web request:**
  
    `proxychains4 curl http://checkip.dyndns.org`
    
3. **Example with `xfreerdp` as in your original command:**
    
    `proxychains4 xfreerdp /v:10.200.113.31 /u:svcScanning /p:Password1!`
    

### Step 5: Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Tor status:**
    
    `sudo service tor status`
    
2. **Ensure Tor is listening on port 9050:**
    
    `netstat -tnlp | grep 9050`
    
3. **Verify proxychains configuration:** Ensure the configuration file `/etc/proxychains4.conf` correctly points to `socks5 127.0.0.1 9050`.
    

### Additional Tips

- **Verbose Mode:** To get more output from `proxychains` for debugging, use the `-v` flag:
    
    `proxychains4 -v xfreerdp /v:10.200.118.31 /u:svcScanning /p:Password1!`
    
- **Quiet Mode:** If you want to suppress `proxychains` output, use the `-q` flag:
    
    `proxychains4 -q xfreerdp /v:10.200.118.31 /u:svcScanning /p:Password1!`
    

By following these steps, you should be able to install, configure, and use `proxychains` on Kali Linux to route your commands through a proxy like Tor.
