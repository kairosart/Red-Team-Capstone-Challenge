## e-citizen
To register, you need to get in touch with the government through its e-Citizen communication portal that uses SSH for communication. Here are the SSH details provided:

| SSH Username | e-citizen                |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| SSH Password | stabilitythroughcurrency |
| SSH IP       | X.X.X.250                |

Once you complete the questions below, the network diagram at the start of the room will show the IP specific to your network. Use that information to replace the X values in your SSH IP.

Once you authenticate, you will be able to communicate with the e-Citizen system. Follow the prompts to register for the challenge, and save the information you get for future reference. Once registered, follow the instructions to verify that you have access to all the relevant systems.
