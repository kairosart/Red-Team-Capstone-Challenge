Welcome to the [Red Team Learning Path](https://www.kairoshack.com/walkthroughs/tryhackme/learning-path/red-team) Capstone Challenge! If you are reading this, we hope you are ready to apply and test the knowledge that you have gained from the learning pathway.

This is an in-depth network challenge simulating a Red Teaming engagement. The challenge includes several phases structured around the cyber kill chain that will require you to:

- Enumerate a perimeter.
    
- Breach the organisation.Â 
    
- Perform lateral movement.
    
- Perform goal execution to show impact.
    

To best simulate how these engagements usually occur, there is no single right answer. Instead, there are multiple paths that can be used to achieve the final goal.

Tested Learning Objectives  

- OSINT (Simulated)
- Enumeration & Fuzzing
- Phishing
- AV Evasion
- Lateral Movement
- AD Exploitation
- Linux and Windows Security Testing
- Privilege Escalation
- Post-Compromise Exploitation
