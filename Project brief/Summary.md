Please make sure you understand the points below before starting. If any point is unclear, please reread this task.

- The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate whether the corporate division can be compromised and, if so, determine if it could result in the compromise of the bank division.

- To demonstrate the compromise, a simulated fraudulent money transfer must be performed by gaining access to the SWIFT core backend banking system.

- The SWIFT backend infrastructure is secure but exposes an internal web application used by TheReserve to facilitate transfers.

- A general process for transfers involves the separation of duties to ensure that one employee cannot both capture and approve the same transfer.

- You have been provided with some information and tools that you may find helpful in the exercise, including a password policy, but you are free to use your own.

- There are rules in place that determine what you are allowed and disallowed to do. Failure to adhere to these rules might result in a ban from the challenge.

- After gaining access to the network, you need to register for the challenge through the e-Citizen communication portal using provided SSH details.

- You will need to prove compromises by performing specific steps on the host that you have compromised. These steps will be provided to you through the e-Citizen portal.
