In order to prove that you have compromised the estate, the government of Trimento requires that you interface with the e-Citizen platform from specific locations in the network. <font color="#0070c0">Once you compromise a host, you should initiate an SSH connection to the e-Citizen platform and perform the requested action to prove the compromise, after which a flag will be provided that you can submit below.</font>

[[SSH connection to the e-Citizen]]
There may be several paths to compromise hosts, so you could receive the same flag on different hosts. To get new flags, you need to compromise additional hosts and systems. The flags indicate progress in the challenge and lead to goal execution. You can follow any path you like and still find all the required flags. In other words, if you reach the level of access that will allow final goal execution, that level of access will also allow you to get all the other flags.

**Notes:**

- Flags are provided both for the initial foothold (low-privileged) access and the full compromise (administrative access).
- In certain cases, your foothold may also directly provide administrative access. In these cases, make the submission for the administrative access flag and then use this level of access to make the submission for the initial low-privileged foothold as well.
- The flags are not in any particular order. You may find that your compromise path allows you to submit flags in a different order than what is listed below.
